# Counterfiet_Banknotes_Binary_Regression_SAS

  Counterfeiting banknotes has been a problem since the introduction of color photocopiers and computer image scanners. 
The bank industry has suffered from counterfeits due to inflation and reduction in the value of real money. Here we have 
been given a dataset that contains different entries for different bills that have been analyzed. There are four 
different variables (variance of wavelet, skewness of wavelet, kurtosis of wavelet, and entropy) within the dataset, and 
a fifth Boolean variable stating whether or not the banknote is real of counterfeit. With this dataset we have been tasked 
with creating a model to predict counterfeit banknotes using SAS we can perform clustering, and potentially create a binary 
regression model that will predict future banknotes authenticity.
